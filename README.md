# Capstone-Project
#### Life Threatening Prediction due to the adverse effects of Covid-19 Vaccination !

#### Industry Review.
With the help of the application of Data Science in healthcare, it has now become possible to detect the symptoms of a disease at a very early stage. Also, with the advent of various innovative tools and technologies, doctors are able to monitor patients’ conditions from remote locations.
    Benefits of Data Science in Healthcare
Data Science helps in advancing healthcare facilities and processes. It helps boost productivity in diagnosis and treatment and enhances the workflow of healthcare systems. The ultimate goals of the healthcare system are as follows:
To ease the workflow of the healthcare system
To reduce the risk of treatment failure
To provide proper treatment on time
To avoid unnecessary emergencies due to the non-availability of doctors
To reduce the waiting time of patients.


#### Understand the dataset: 
In this project we are trying to predict the possibility of death after vaccination. 
We are mainly focusing on adverse effects of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines
There are 49021 records and there are 51 features 
Our target is ‘DIED’ column which contains the information of what is the possibility of death post vaccination. 
We have taken 3 datasets: 
Vaccine dataset :- Some important columns are VAX_TYPE  (Administered Vaccine Type), VAX_MANU (Vaccine Manufacturer), VAX_DOSE_SERIES (Number of doses) etc.
Demographic dataset :- Some important columns are DIED ( Target Variable), HOSPDAYS (Number of days Hospitalized), NUMDAYS :Number of days (Onset date - Vax. Date), L_THREAT  (Life-Threatening Illness ), CURR_ILL ( Current Illness) etc. 
Symptom dataset :- Some important columns are Symptom 1, Symptom 2, Symptom 3 , Symptom 4 and Symptom 5 etc.
